## Development Recommendations

### State Management
Current: React Context (sufficient for auth)
Future: Consider Redux Toolkit or Zustand when state gets complex

### API Caching
Current: None
Future: Add React Query for API caching and optimistic updates

### Offline Support
Current: None
Future: Add offline-first with WatermelonDB

### Testing
Current: None
Future:
- Jest for unit tests
- React Native Testing Library for component tests
- Detox for E2E tests

### Monitoring
Current: Console logs
Future:
- Sentry for crash reporting
- Firebase Analytics for user behavior
- Performance monitoring

---

## Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size
- Development: ~50MB (includes dev tools)
- Production: TBD (will be optimized)

### Build Times
- TypeScript check: ~5 seconds
