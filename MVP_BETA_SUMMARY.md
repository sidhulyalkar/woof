# PetPath MVP Beta - Complete Feature Set

## üéØ Project Vision
**PetPath** is a dog owner social network focused on driving **IRL (in-real-life) meetups** while collecting uniquely valuable datasets that competitors ignore. The app positions itself for superior ML models and product insights through systematic outcome labeling and conversion tracking.

## üìä North Star Metrics

1. **Meetup Conversion Rate** = confirmed meetups / unique match chats
2. **7-Day Retention** = % users returning within 7 days
3. **Data Yield per User** = labeled interactions + verified outcomes
4. **Service Intent Rate** = service taps to book / MAU

## üîÑ Data Collection Strategy

### What Makes PetPath Unique

**Competitors** (Rover, BarkHappy, etc.) collect:
- Basic profile data
- Service bookings
- Simple ratings

**PetPath** collects:
- ‚úÖ **Meetup outcomes** - Did the proposed meetup actually happen?
- ‚úÖ **Quality labels** - How was the meetup? (rating + tags)
- ‚úÖ **Service conversions** - Did they book after clicking "Book"?
- ‚úÖ **Event feedback** - Multi-dimensional ratings for ML training
- ‚úÖ **Co-activity patterns** - Real-world GPS overlap data
- ‚úÖ **Engagement signals** - Streaks, points, badge unlocks

### ML Training Data Pipeline

1. **Meetup Proposals** ‚Üí Outcome labels (success/failure)
2. **Service Intents** ‚Üí Conversion labels (booked/didn't book)
3. **Event Feedback** ‚Üí Quality scores (vibe/density/venue)
4. **Match Interactions** ‚Üí Preference signals (like/skip/super_like)
5. **Co-Activity** ‚Üí Movement patterns and neighborhood preferences

This data enables:
- **Better matching algorithms** (learn from successful meetups)
- **Predictive models** (which proposals will convert?)
- **Venue recommendations** (which parks/caf√©s work best?)
- **Monetization** (service conversion prediction)
