// Add to schema.prisma

model BadgeAward {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId    String   @map("user_id")
  badgeType String   @map("badge_type")
  awardedAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("awarded_at")

  @@unique([userId, badgeType])
  @@index([userId])
  @@map("badge_awards")
}

model WeeklyStreak {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId         String   @unique @map("user_id")
  currentWeek    Int      @default(0) @map("current_week")
  lastActivityAt DateTime @map("last_activity_at")
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  @@map("weekly_streaks")
}
```

Add relation to CommunityEvent:
```prisma
model CommunityEvent {
  // ... existing fields
  hostUserId String @map("host_user_id")

  organizer User @relation("EventHost", fields: [hostUserId], references: [id])
  // ... rest
}
```

Add to User model:
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  totalPoints Int @default(0) @map("total_points")

  hostedEvents CommunityEvent[] @relation("EventHost")
  // ... rest
}
```

**Then run:**

```

#### Load Testing (1 hour)
```bash
# Use k6 or Artillery
# Target: 100 concurrent users, <200ms p95 latency
```
