# Advanced ML Models for Pet Matching - Comprehensive Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Project:** Woof/PetPath
**Focus:** Multi-Model ML Architecture with Adaptive Feedback

---

## Executive Summary

We've developed a comprehensive, state-of-the-art machine learning system for pet matching that goes far beyond traditional recommendation systems. The system implements **4 distinct modeling approaches** plus a **hybrid ensemble** with **adaptive feedback loops** for continuous improvement.

### Key Innovation: Multi-Model Hybrid Approach

Rather than relying on a single model, we've created:
1. **Graph Attention Network (GNN)** - For structural relationship modeling
2. **SimGNN** - For similarity-based graph matching
3. **Diffusion Model** - For generative matching with uncertainty quantification
4. **Hybrid Ensemble** - Adaptive weighting that learns which model to trust
5. **Feedback Loop System** - Active learning to improve with user interaction

## 1. Graph Attention Network (GAT) Model

**File:** `ml/models/gnn_compatibility.py` (420 lines)
**Parameters:** 193,545
**Purpose:** Model pet compatibility through social graph structure

### Architecture

```
Input: Pet Features + Social Graph
  ↓
Feature Encoder (Breed, Temperament, Size, Energy, Age, Weight)
  ↓
3x Graph Attention Layers (GATv2Conv)
  - 4 attention heads per layer
  - Edge features (interaction strength)
  - Batch normalization
  ↓
Multi-task Prediction:
  - Compatibility Score (0-1)
  - Confidence Estimate
  - Attention Weights (interpretability)
```

### Key Features
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Learns which connections matter most
- **Edge Features**: Uses interaction history for better predictions
- **Multi-head Attention**: Captures different relationship aspects
- **Interpretable**: Attention weights show WHY pets match

### Training
- **Script:** `ml/training/train_gnn.py`
- **Data:** 500 pets, 2,500 edges, 11 communities
- **Optimization:** AdamW with learning rate scheduling
- **Early Stopping:** Patience-based to prevent overfitting

## 2. SimGNN: Similarity Graph Neural Network

**File:** `ml/models/simgnn.py` (400+ lines)
**Purpose:** Compute similarity between pet social graphs

### Architecture

```

    ↓                        ↓
Graph Encoder (GCN)    Graph Encoder (GCN)
    ↓                        ↓
Attention Pooling      Attention Pooling
    ↓                        ↓

```

### Key Innovations

1. **Neural Tensor Network (NTN)**
   - 16 tensor layers for bilinear interactions
   - Captures complex similarity patterns
   - Formula: `score = f(e1^T * M_k * e2)` for k tensors

2. **Histogram Matching**
   - Computes pairwise node similarities
   - Creates histogram of similarity distribution
   - Captures fine-grained structural differences

3. **Cross-Graph Attention** (Enhanced version)
   - Nodes from different graphs attend to each other
   - Learns which features to compare
   - Multi-head attention for diversity

### Advantages over GAT
- **Graph-level matching**: Compares entire social networks
- **Fine-grained**: Histogram features capture distribution
- **Flexible**: Works with varying graph sizes

## 3. Graph Diffusion Model

**File:** `ml/models/graph_diffusion.py` (500+ lines)
**Purpose:** Generative matching with uncertainty quantification

### Core Concept

Diffusion models learn to reverse a noise process:
1. **Forward Process**: Gradually add noise to matching scores
2. **Reverse Process**: Learn to denoise and recover optimal matches

```
Clean Match Score → ... → Noise
      x_0           x_t      x_T

Training: Learn p(x_{t-1} | x_t)
Inference: Sample x_0 ~ p(x_0 | x_T)
```

### Architecture

```
Input: Pet 1 Features + Pet 2 Features
  ↓
Time-Conditioned GNN
  - Sinusoidal time embeddings
  - GNN layers with time projection
  - Denoises features at each timestep
  ↓
Diffusion Scheduler
  - 1000 timesteps
  - Linear beta schedule
  - DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)
  ↓
Output: Matching Score + Uncertainty
```

### Key Features

1. **Uncertainty Quantification**
   - Multiple samples → distribution of scores
   - Identifies ambiguous matches
   - Triggers feedback loop for uncertain cases

2. **Conditional Diffusion**
   - Incorporates user preferences
   - Adapts to historical data
   - Personalized matching

3. **Generative Power**
   - Can generate diverse matching scenarios
   - Explores match space thoroughly
   - Not limited to training distribution

### Advantages
- **Uncertainty-aware**: Knows when it doesn't know
- **Robust**: Handles novel combinations
- **Flexible**: Easy to condition on user feedback

## 4. Hybrid Ensemble Model

**File:** `ml/models/hybrid_ensemble.py` (600+ lines)
**Purpose:** Adaptively combine all models with meta-learning

### Architecture

```
Input: Pet Pair

    ↓ ↓ ↓

GAT Model  SimGNN  Diffusion
  0.75      0.82      0.68

    ↓ ↓ ↓

Context Encoder
(extracts pair features)

    ↓

Adaptive Weighting Module
(learns optimal weights)
w_GAT=0.3, w_SimGNN=0.5, w_Diff=0.2

    ↓

Final Prediction = Σ(w_i * pred_i)

    ↓

Uncertainty Estimator
(ensemble disagreement)
```

### Components

## 5. Adaptive Feedback Loop System

**Purpose:** Active learning to collect richer data

### How It Works

```
1. Model makes prediction with uncertainty
   ↓
2. High uncertainty detected (>threshold)
   ↓
3. Question Generator identifies information gaps
   ↓
4. Ask user targeted questions:
   - "Does your pet enjoy high-energy play?"
   - "Prefers one-on-one or group activities?"
   - "Comfortable with new dogs?"
   ↓
5. User responses update pet features
   ↓
6. Re-run prediction with richer data
   ↓
7. Improved match quality
```

### Components

#### 1. Question Generator
- **Information Gain**: Selects most valuable questions
- **Priority Ranking**: Asks most important first
- **Diverse Probes**: Covers different aspects

#### 2. Feature Updater
- **Residual Updates**: Refines existing features

- **Maintains Coherence**: Doesn't contradict known info

#### 3. Rich Data Prober
- **20 Question Types**: Comprehensive coverage
- **Adaptive Selection**: Chooses based on current knowledge
- **Uncertainty-Driven**: Focuses on ambiguous areas

### Question Bank Examples
```python
{
    0: "Does your pet enjoy playing with other dogs/cats?",
    1: "Is your pet comfortable with high-energy activities?",
    2: "Does your pet prefer indoor or outdoor activities?",
    3: "How does your pet react to new pets?",
    4: "Does your pet enjoy structured playtime?",
    # ... 15 more questions
}
```
