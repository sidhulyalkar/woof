## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
2. **Redis**: For caching and queues
3. **n8n**: Workflow automation (optional for initial testing)

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis n8n

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Setup environment variables
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local

# 4. Run database migrations
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
pnpm prisma db seed

# 5. Start development servers
# Terminal 1 - API
cd apps/api
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2 - Web
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

### Test Data

Run the seed script to populate SF-specific test data:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma db seed
```

This creates:
- 20 SF-based test users
- 30+ pets with complete profiles
- 10+ community events in SF locations

# Test with Artillery
artillery quick --count 100 --num 10 http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health

# Expected:
# - 95th percentile latency < 500ms
# - 0% error rate
# - No memory leaks
```

- [ ] `EVENT_CHECKIN` - When checking into event
- [ ] `POINTS_EARNED` - When points awarded

### North Star Metrics

Navigate to `/analytics/north-star` (admin only):

- [ ] **Meetup Conversion Rate**: Should show % of matches â†’ confirmed meetups
- [ ] **7-Day Retention**: % of users returning within 7 days
- [ ] **Data Yield per User**: Avg labeled interactions per user
- [ ] **Service Intent Rate**: % of users tapping service CTAs

### Screen Views

```bash
# Query screen analytics
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/analytics/screens?timeframe=7d

# Expected: Top screens like:
